# Memory Card Game

Classic memory card game with eight pairs to match. All cards have a spring theme.

## How it works

Click on two cards, when they match they will stay visible. Otherwise they will turn around and you can try again. The game is over when all pairs are found. Stats will tell you how good you were. Isn't that motivating?

## Play
